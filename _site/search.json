The opening pattern. The first four shots.\nThat small window decides how the majority of points unfold — and once you see it, the sport stops looking chaotic and starts looking structured.\nLet’s break it open.\n\n\n\nTV’s bias towards long rallies creates a warped picture:\n\nlong rallies get shown\nshort points disappear\ncommentators talk over the early action\nviewers come away thinking rallies decide matches\n\nIn reality:\nTennis is a serve–return–first-ball sport that occasionally produces long rallies — not the other way around.\nOnce you understand that, the match becomes legible.\n\n\n\n\nEvery point begins with the same hidden structure:\n[ Serve ] → [ Return ] → [ Server’s 1st Groundstroke ] → [ Returner’s 1st Groundstroke ]\nThose four touches decide:\n\nwho is dictating\nwho is defending\nwho will be pushed back\nwho gets the first attacking ball\n\nA long rally often starts with something that went right or wrong in these first four shots, not something that magically happens later.\n\n\n\n\nHere’s the real shape of a tennis match:\n\n\nA typical 100-point match looks roughly like this:\n0–4 shots : ██████████████████████████  ~70%\n5–8 shots : ██████                     ~20%\n9+ shots  : ██                         ~10%\nFans remember the 10%.
