# Inside Rail

Inside Rail is a sports analytics project looking at tennis, horse racing, and the NFL as **markets**, not just games.

To start, we’re launching the **Inside Rail Tennis** series:

- A new way of watching and understanding tennis
- Built around first-strike patterns, serve/return structure, and rally-length data
