# CHAPTER 1 — THE CALL

Before you ever sit down at NL2, the first hand is already dealt.

It isn’t on the table.  
It’s in your head.

The journey begins with a quiet, comforting lie:

> **“I’m probably a small winner… must just be running bad.”**

It’s almost sweet, really.  
The sort of thing you whisper to yourself while the graph on PokerTracker looks like it’s trying to tunnel into the earth.

You’re not being dishonest.  
You’re being human.

![A solitary path disappearing into fog and shadow, symbolising the beginning of a difficult journey.](../images/ch1-opening.png)

> **“Every journey begins with a lie you tell yourself.”**  
> *— Inside Rail*

The lie isn’t malicious.  
It’s not even conscious.  
It’s simply the soft, warm blanket every beginner wraps themselves in when the numbers in PokerTracker look like a heart monitor in a collapsing A&E unit.

Your graph resembles the flight path of a drunk pigeon.  
Your bankroll resembles the GDP of a small island nation in crisis.  
And yet, somehow, deep inside, you are convinced:

**“I’m good at this.”**

This is **The Ordinary World** of the NL2 hero —  
a strange place where £6 feels like a mortgage payment  
and losing three buy-ins feels like you’ve been financially assaulted behind a Tesco Express.

The strange thing about the micro-stakes is not the stakes.  
It’s the **emotional exchange rate**.

At NL2, money is tiny and feelings are enormous.  
A twenty-pence loss can ruin a mood.  
A four-dollar win can fuel a week-long fantasy of semi-professional greatness.

It’s here you find the first cracks forming:

- *Denial:* “These idiots call everything. Impossible to beat.”  
- *Bargaining:* “If I just tighten up a little…”  
- *Anger:* “How do you call THAT?!”  
- *Depression:* “Why do I even do this to myself?”  
- *Acceptance:* “Okay, one more session.”

This cycle repeats.  
Daily.  
Hourly.  
Sometimes hand-to-hand.

You study ranges.  
You know jargon.  
You’ve watched YouTube.  
So naturally you think:

> **“Half these players don’t even know what a range is…  
why can’t I crush these idiots?”**

Every micro-stakes hero starts here — with the exact cocktail of confidence, entitlement, delusion, and frustration required to create the perfect victim for what comes next.

Because once you look online for answers, you meet **The False Mentors**.

And they come in three species.

## **I. The Doomsayers**

They greet you with open arms and closed minds.

**“Micro-stakes are a trap!”**  
**“The rake is unbeatable!”**  
**“You’ll never climb from NL2!”**

They speak with the certainty of prophets and the experience of people who’ve never beaten a game in their lives.  
According to them, PokerStars personally installed a ceiling above NL5 to keep you poor.

You don’t realise it yet, but these people aren’t warning you.  
They’re projecting.

## **II. The Conspiracists**

Next come the whisperers:

**“NL2 is full of bots.”**  
**“The RNG is rigged.”**  
**“They reward the fish and punish the regs.”**

These are the guardians of the Ancient Lore of Online Poker — a sacred tradition dating back to the first man who lost a pot with Aces and declared the site corrupt.

You haven’t even bought in yet, and already the world feels hostile.

## **III. The Salesmen**

And then, as if by cosmic coincidence, you discover the third category.

The ones who smile too warmly.

**“Skip NL2.”**  
**“Start at NL25.”**  
**“Micro-stakes will ruin your fundamentals.”**  
**“…and for only *$997*, you can follow my five-step blueprint to success.”**

Ah.

There it is.

The first temptation of the journey:  
the shortcut.

They tell you to flee the village, abandon the first step of the path, and leap straight into greatness — preferably by wiring your credit card details to a wizard with a paid Discord group.

You don’t know any better, so all these voices swirl into one overwhelming truth:

**“This game is impossible,  
you’re not good enough,  
and also, please buy my course.”**

The noise is deafening.  
The contradictions maddening.  
The fear intoxicating.

And then — in the middle of all this —  
you hear something else.

A quieter voice.  
Not shouting.  
Not selling.  
Not panicking.

A voice that simply says:

> **“You’re going to play anyway.”**

That voice… well… that’s me.

The old wizard in the corner of the tavern.  
The one who has seen every broken mouse, every rage deposit, every “fuck this I’m going to NL100 where they play proper poker” moment a thousand times.

I know the dangers of the journey.  
But I will not forbid you.

Everyone walks this road.  
Everyone ignores advice at least once.  
Everyone chases losses into the jaws of a higher stake.  
Everyone thinks they’re above NL2 until NL2 humbles them.

I merely smile, because I already know how Chapter 2 ends.

But this is your story.

And so, after all the noise, after all the doubt, after all the contradictory prophecies, you feel something small but undeniable:

**hope.**

A spark.

A need to prove something — to yourself, not to anyone else.

You load the client.

Your balance is meagre.  
Your confidence is uneven.  
Your mouse rests under your hand like a weapon you aren’t trained to use.

And then it happens.

Your finger moves.  
The cursor drifts.

**NL2 — £2 Buy-in.**  
A world you think you understand.  
A world that is about to test you more than you realise.

> **Click.**

The door opens.

The journey begins.
